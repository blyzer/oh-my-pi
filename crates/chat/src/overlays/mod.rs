//! Observer-local overlays: approval prompts projected from controller-owned
//! DOM state, plus the model picker, prompt-history picker, and transient
//! notices that live only in the actor (ADR 0005).
//!
//! Every other overlay (session picker, tree, rewind, dashboards, side
//! panels) is a [`Panel`]: a retained component the host stacks, routes keys
//! to, and composites by its [`PanelAnchor`]. Panels ask for effects through
//! [`PanelEvent`] — a console line (ADR 0014), a composer recall, a notice,
//! a clipboard write — and never touch the session DOM.
