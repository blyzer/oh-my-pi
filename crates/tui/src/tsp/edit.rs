/// The terminal replaced `[from, to)` with `text` and put its caret at
/// `cursor`, in UTF-16 code units of a text `len` units long. When `len` is
/// not `current`'s length, keys in flight changed the text: the edit is
/// stale and `None`. Offsets are clamped and reversed ends swapped; a range
/// end inside a surrogate pair takes the whole character. `text` is
/// sanitized like a paste, and the caret is carried from the terminal's
/// result onto the text the sanitized replacement produces.
