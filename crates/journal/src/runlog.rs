//! The record vocabulary and writer of an ADW run journal (ADR 0051 S1 to S3).
//!
//! A run journal is a normal journal file whose vocabulary is widened with the
//! [`vocabulary`] kinds. The first record is always [`RunStart`]; every later
//! entry names the previous one in `by`, so the file is a linear chain, and a
//! finished run (a [`RunDone`] or [`RunHalt`] record) accepts nothing more.
