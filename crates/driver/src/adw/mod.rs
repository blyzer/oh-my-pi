//! Host for the AI developer workflow domain.
//!
//! `omp-adw` is a pure state machine: it decides which phase may dispatch, how
//! many attempts one has consumed, and what a rejection invalidates. It
//! performs no I/O. This module is the other half — it reads the project's
//! workflow declaration, resolves the execution posture the domain compares
//! requirements against, dispatches what the domain hands back, and reports
//! outcomes in.
//!
//! The split is load-bearing: acceptance is host-owned, so gate results arrive
//! here as observed evidence and go *into* the domain, rather than the domain
//! reaching out for them.
