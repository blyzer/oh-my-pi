"""Check the single-workflow CI gate.

CI is one workflow, ci.yml. A pull request is never filtered out of it by a
path filter (a filtered workflow reports nothing, so its required checks stay
pending). Instead the `changes` job matches the pull request's files against
.github/ci-paths.txt and the other jobs skip themselves, which a required check
counts as passing. This script verifies the pieces that must agree:

* ci.yml's `push.paths` list equals .github/ci-paths.txt;
* ci.yml's `pull_request` trigger carries no `paths` or `paths-ignore` filter;
* every required status check in .github/rulesets/omp2-protected.json is the
  `name:` of a job in ci.yml, because a required check is matched by name;
* in every workflow a pull request can start, a job whose `runs-on` could name
  a self-hosted runner (anything but a plain GitHub-hosted label) sends a pull
  request from another repository to a hosted label first, with the `rust`
  job's fork test verbatim, and the BuildBuddy trust action applies that test.

Plain text scanning keeps this free of third-party YAML dependencies.
