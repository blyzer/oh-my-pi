# Gap 12: TUI job widgets and auto-graph charts

Status: research only. Nothing here is implemented or authorized.
Date: 2026-11-13
Baseline: omp2 f4186b783b; upstream c308970263 (pinned checkout).

Evidence keys:

- **OBSERVED** means read in code or docs at the baseline. Citations use `path:line`. Upstream paths carry the `upstream:` prefix.
- **[INFERENCE]** means the author's reasoning. Every size estimate is an inference.
- **UNVERIFIED** means no run or source confirmed it.

No build, test or run was made for this document.

## Question

Upstream draws two things omp2 does not: live widgets for background jobs (charts, bars and meters derived from a job's output) and automatic charts under numeric tables in the assistant's answers. What are they, how big are they, and what would a fit with `crates/tui` look like?

Out of scope: the Tern (TSP) chart nodes, and upstream's `wait`-card layout details.

## 1. Upstream

### Job widgets

A widget is data, not code. A cheap model writes a declarative spec once per job. A deterministic runtime applies the spec to each new output line. Renderers draw the result (`upstream:packages/tui/src/tools/job-widget.ts:1-13`).

- **Surfaces:** the `wait` card, the HUD's jobs pill with a hover card, and the jobs sheet (`upstream:packages/tui/src/tools/job-widget.ts:3-5`). The user-facing description is in `upstream:docs/settings.md:654`; the switch is `async.widgets`, default on, and off means plain job rows.
- **Job inputs:** a job offers text sources (`out`, `pipe:1`, `tools`, ...) readable from any retained offset, and a brief (kind `bash` or `task`, the command, timeout, intent, and for tasks a watch hint and stage) (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/types.ts:35-41`, `upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/types.ts:44-65`).
- **Spec:** up to 12 rules and 4 blocks (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/spec.ts:157-160`). A rule is a Rust-regex line matcher with named groups that feed numeric or text fields, with an optional split key, scale and count field (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/spec.ts:47-62`). Fields reduce with one of ten aggregates (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/spec.ts:14`). Blocks are spark, bars, meter, stat, grid and text (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/spec.ts:86-137`). Validation requires every regex to compile, every field a block reads to be fed by a rule, and the rules to match the sample lines the author saw (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/spec.ts:1-7`).
- **Authoring:** one toolless request to the `widget` model role (which aliases `smol`) with a forced `respond` call carrying the spec schema, fed the brief and redacted output samples (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/author.ts:1-5`).
- **Runtime:** no model past the spec. It reads new text per source, applies the rules in one native `LineMatcher` call per refresh, folds matches into per-field state and builds the view. Work per refresh is proportional to the new text, with bounded rings (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/runtime.ts:1-8`).
- **Registry and cadence:** refresh every 1 s while someone watches, at least 250 ms between reads of one job, a spec may be requested only after the job is 15 s old, at most 2 requests in flight, with drift detection that re-authors when unmatched lines pile up (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/registry.ts:17-45`).
- **Fallback:** the view state is `authoring`, `live` or `fallback`; with no spec the view shows only the last line and rates (`upstream:packages/tui/src/tools/job-widget.ts:25-32`).
- **Captions:** a second cheap-model use writes one plain-English line per command job saying what it does and when it ends. It sees the command and intent, never the output (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/caption.ts:1-6`).
- **Rendering:** the view is drawn as TSP nodes or as ANSI lines. Progress uses a progress bar component and series use a block sparkline, `▁▂▃▄▅▆▇█` (`upstream:packages/tui/src/tools/job-widget.ts:15-17`, `upstream:packages/tui/src/components/sparkline.ts:1-7`). The view carries a title, headline, stage, blocks, state and update time (`upstream:packages/tui/src/tools/job-widget.ts:128-139`).
- **Size:** about 2,500 lines of coding-agent code (runtime 928, spec 853, registry 440, author 273, others) plus about 1,050 lines of TUI rendering. Counts are from `wc -l` on the pinned checkout.

### Auto-graph charts

- Setting `tui.autoGraph`, default `auto`: numeric tables in assistant answers get a chart in the theme's colors on terminals that show graphics. `always` uses the built-in guess, `smart` lets the judge refine it (`upstream:docs/settings.md:917`). The changelog says `auto` refines by judge only for supported native judge models and otherwise uses the built-in estimate (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md:791`).
- Pipeline: `analyzeTable`, then `planChart` (the local guess), `buildChart`, `renderChartSvg`, with `worthCharting` deciding whether the picture says more than the table (`upstream:packages/tui/src/charts/chart-plan.ts:1-8`). The heuristics were fitted on about 7,000 real tables: first text column is the label, index columns never are, table order is kept, total rows stay out of the scale, units never share an axis, a baseline row becomes the reference, and values spanning decades draw as factors of change (`upstream:packages/tui/src/charts/chart-plan.ts:10-21`).
- Model refinement: two judge rounds. First a reading of the table (which column names rows, which numbers lead, which way each measure is better), then a choice among candidate charts each described as what it would draw (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/auto-graph/planner.ts:1-19`).
- Delivery: `splitTableCharts` cuts a Markdown block after each table that gets a chart; the chart is cached per table source and shown as a terminal image rasterized in the theme, or as an SVG fence for a TSP terminal (`upstream:packages/tui/src/chat/table-chart.ts:1-10`).
- Size: about 11,300 lines in the chart code (`chart-plan.ts` 5,045, `chart-svg.ts` 4,654, `table-data.ts` 1,567) plus 1,092 for the planner and 284 for `table-chart.ts`. The planning prompt is a 16.5 KB JSON file (`upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/judge/auto-graph.json`). A port of that size is a project, not a slice. [INFERENCE]

## 2. omp2 inventory

### Components and charset rules

- `omp-tui` is a retained component tree with `dom!`, a differential renderer, graphics, markdown and a Tern surface protocol (`crates/tui/README.md:3-14`). Components include `progress`, `table`, `img`, `scene`, `shader`, `spinner`, `status`, `tool_card` and `todo` (directory `crates/tui/src/components`).
- No sparkline and no chart component: a search for `spark` and `chart` in `crates/tui/src` found only colour names and Mermaid flowchart handling (`crates/tui/src/markdown/mermaid.rs:109`). The TSP wire has no chart node (same search).
- `Progress` backs the `<progress>` tag and draws `██████░░` (`crates/tui/src/components/progress.rs:10`, test at `crates/tui/src/components/progress.rs:136`).
- Charset is `Unicode`, `NerdFont` or `Ascii` and reaches every component. `AGENTS.md` bans hardcoded colours and hand-emitted glyphs; icons come from `icons.tsv` (`crates/tui/src/context.rs:41-49`, `AGENTS.md:460-462`). A block sparkline needs an ASCII fallback and a theme tone, so its glyph ramp belongs in the icon or charset layer, not in the component.
- Graphics: terminal capability detection and image paths exist (`crates/tui/src/graphics.rs:1-6`, `crates/tui/src/sixel.rs`, `crates/tui/src/components/img.rs`). SVG rasterization exists elsewhere: `omp-tools` rasterizes SVG with `resvg` for image reads (`crates/tools/src/read/image.rs:240`, `crates/tools/src/read/image.rs:308`). `omp-tui` does not depend on `resvg` (`crates/tui/Cargo.toml:28-36`).
- Markdown tables go through `render_table` (`crates/tui/src/markdown/table.rs:197`). That is the hook where a chart would attach.
- Dependencies already in the workspace: `regex` (`Cargo.toml:215`), `resvg` (`Cargo.toml:217`), `image` (`Cargo.toml:89`).

### Job data and surfaces

- Job state lives in the session DOM under `<meta><jobs>` (`crates/agent/src/jobs.rs:1-6`). The `/hub` overlay reads each `<subagent>` and `<job>` row into `JobRow` with id, kind (`subagent`, `tool`, `process`), status, owner, agent, model, start time and a JSON `data` payload (`crates/chat/src/overlays/hub.rs:92-109`, `crates/chat/src/overlays/hub.rs:113`).
- The status band has a `Jobs` chip showing a count with a job icon (`crates/chat/src/status_band.rs:1494`, `crates/chat/src/status_band.rs:1994-1997`).
- The `wait`/`jobs` card renders job snapshots with id, kind, label, text, wall time and status (`crates/chat/src/cards/hub.rs:437-480`).
- Live output: a running call's output frames are appended to the call's `<result>` text stream, in sequence, up to an inline byte limit, with the rest spilled to a content-addressed stage (`crates/agent/src/dispatch.rs:944-967`). So a text source for a running tool job exists in the DOM; how named `process` jobs expose live output was not traced: UNVERIFIED.
- Model roles: the built-in role ids include `smol`, `tiny`, `judge` and `memory` but no `widget` (`crates/catalog/src/selection.rs:175-178`).

### Gap table

| Piece | Upstream | omp2 | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Block sparkline | yes, 89 lines | none | small component plus icon-layer ramp |
| Progress bar | yes | `Progress` | none |
| Job widget view model | `JobWidgetView` | none | new type |
| Spec (rules, blocks) and validator | 853 lines | none | port, or replace |
| Deterministic runtime | 928 lines, native line matcher | none | port; `regex` is available |
| Spec author (`widget` role) | cheap model, forced `respond` | no `widget` role | add role or reuse `smol` |
| Captions | yes | none | optional, separate |
| Surfaces | `wait` card, HUD pill, jobs sheet | `wait` card, `Jobs` chip count, `/hub` | add widget row to each |
| Job text sources | pipes, taps, task tool output | DOM `<result>` stream for tool calls | partial; process jobs UNVERIFIED |
| Table chart planner | 5,000+ lines | none | large |
| Chart rasterization | SVG to terminal image | `resvg` only in `omp-tools` | new dependency edge |
| Chart on TSP | SVG fence | no chart node | out of scope |

## 3. Class

**Class c (port)** for job widgets, staged. The runtime, spec model and view are TypeScript and small enough to rewrite in Rust. Part of it needs no port at all: the model-free fallback view is new omp2 code over data omp2 already has.

**Class c, deferred** for auto-graph. It is a port, but of about 12,000 lines whose value depends on a graphics-capable terminal. A smaller local text chart is a class d proposal inside the plan.

Verdict: build stages 1 and 2 of the job widgets; decide on the rest after that; defer auto-graph.

## 4. Options

### Job widgets

1. **Build on existing omp2 code.** Extend the `Jobs` chip and the `/hub` job row to show the last output line and a rate, with no model and no rules. Cost: 2 to 3 days. Fit: good. It is the same "fallback" state upstream has, and it needs only the DOM result stream and `JobRow` (`crates/chat/src/overlays/hub.rs:92-109`). It cannot draw series or meters.
2. **Port the full pipeline** (spec, validator, runtime, author, registry). Cost: 2 to 3 weeks for the 2,500 lines plus tests. Fit: good in the end, but it ships a model-authored regex feature before anyone knows the surface is wanted.
3. **Port the runtime and a fixed set of built-in rules** (no model authoring): known commands such as `cargo`, `pytest` and `curl` get hand-written rule sets. Cost: medium. Fit: deterministic, which AGENTS.md prefers, but it covers only commands someone wrote rules for.

Choice: option 1 first, then the runtime from option 2 with built-in rule sets from option 3, and the model author last and only if wanted. This keeps "deterministic rules first, a model only where rules cannot". [INFERENCE]

### Auto-graph

1. **Port the whole pipeline with SVG rasterization.** Cost: weeks, plus a `resvg` edge from `omp-tui`. Fit: poor now.
2. **A local text chart under a numeric table**, built from the sparkline and block bars, no model, no SVG. Cost: 3 to 5 days. Fit: works on every terminal, themed through the charset layer.
3. **Defer.**

Choice: option 3 now. If wanted later, option 2, then image charts through a rasterizer callback the host supplies so `omp-tui` stays free of `resvg`. [INFERENCE]

## 5. Plan

### Slice 1: sparkline component

- Add a `<spark>` component to `crates/tui/src/components` taking a slice of numbers and a width. The glyph ramp comes from the charset layer (eight blocks in Unicode and NerdFont, an ASCII ramp otherwise). The colour is a theme tone.
- Acceptance: golden frame tests in all three charsets; a constant series draws the lowest block; values above the domain clamp to the full block; width smaller than the series keeps the newest values.
- Gate: none; a component with no caller is inert.

### Slice 2: model-free job row

- A `JobWidgetView` with title, last output line and a rate, drawn in the `/hub` job row and the `Jobs` chip's detail, from the DOM result stream. No model call.
- Acceptance: a running tool job shows its newest output line within one render tick; a job with no output shows its status; output that was spilled past the inline limit still shows the retained tail; the transcript is not repainted by refreshes.
- Gate: default-off convar `sv_job_widgets`.
- Tests: snapshot tests beside `crates/chat/src/cards/hub.rs`.

### Slice 3: rule runtime with built-in rule sets

- Port the rule and field model with the `regex` crate, bounded rings and the ten aggregates; keep the limits of 12 rules and 4 blocks. Ship rule sets for a few common commands. The runtime reads only the job's own output and never tool-result text a job fetched (upstream fixed a leak of exactly that: `upstream:packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md:829`; and percentage meters needed special handling: `upstream:packages/coding-agent/CHANGELOG.md:1154`).
- Acceptance: recorded output of each supported command replays to the expected view; work per refresh is proportional to new text (a test appends 1 MB in small chunks and bounds total time); a rule that stops matching degrades to the slice 2 view.
- Gate: `sv_job_widgets`.

### Slice 4: model-written specs (only if wanted)

- Add the author with a `widget` role or an alias to `smol`, a forced-call schema, validation against the samples before use, redaction of samples, at most 2 requests in flight, and a start only after 15 s.
- Acceptance: a fake author returns a spec that validates and drives the view; an invalid spec is rejected without effect; secrets in samples are redacted before the request.
- Gate: `sv_job_widgets_author`, default off. A `widget` role changes the stable role vocabulary (`crates/catalog/src/selection.rs:172-178` calls it the public contract), so aliasing `smol` is safer. Owner decision.

### Slice 5 (deferred): local text chart under tables

- Hook `render_table` (`crates/tui/src/markdown/table.rs:197`); for a table with one numeric column and a text label column, draw block bars. Decide with a small `worthCharting` rule.
- Acceptance: tables with no numeric column or a single row get no chart; ASCII charset still renders; widths adapt.
- Gate: default-off convar `sv_table_charts`.

Where the code goes: components and the ramp in `crates/tui`; the view model, rules and runtime near `crates/chat` or a small new crate, so `omp-tui` does not learn about jobs (check the crate-boundary rules in `AGENTS.md` first); the author in the agent or driver layer beside other judge users.

## 6. Open questions

1. **Render budget.** A 1 s refresh over many jobs must not repaint the transcript. Draw widgets only in a status or hover surface and let the retained `Ui` diff them (`crates/tui/README.md:11`).
2. **Secret leakage.** Authoring samples can contain secrets. Upstream redacts them; omp2 needs the same, with a test.
3. **A `widget` role.** It changes the stable role vocabulary. Owner decision; aliasing `smol` avoids it.
4. **Replay.** Whether views are journaled or recomputed on resume. Upstream rebuilds them from output after a reload (comment at `upstream:packages/tui/src/tools/job-widget.ts:126`).
5. **Live output for named `process` jobs** was not traced (UNVERIFIED).
6. **Where to put the runtime**: `crates/chat`, or a new crate. Check `AGENTS.md` crate rules.
7. UNVERIFIED: `resvg` rasterization cost on large charts; whether the Tern surface needs a chart node.
8. No locked ADR conflicts found. All additions are new convars and components; no existing tool, hook, scheme or CLI command changes.

## 7. Upstream origin and license

A port would draw from `upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/job-widgets/` (spec, runtime, registry, author, caption, types), `upstream:packages/tui/src/tools/job-widget.ts`, `upstream:packages/tui/src/components/sparkline.ts` and, if auto-graph is ever built, `upstream:packages/tui/src/charts/`, `upstream:packages/tui/src/chat/table-chart.ts` and `upstream:packages/coding-agent/src/auto-graph/planner.ts`. All TypeScript, to be rewritten in Rust. The upstream `LICENSE` is MIT (copyright Mario Zechner, Can Bölük, Stencil Labs, Inc.; `upstream:LICENSE:1-5`).
